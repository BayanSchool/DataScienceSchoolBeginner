# Data Science School Beginner
 
In this course we will work with the following resources:

1. **Jupyter Notebooks** with code snippets relevant to the pertaining topic
2. **Materials** to upskill your understanding on the topic and help you see in new light
3. **Cheatsheets** for every topic to help you think in the nick of time

Below is a brief description of what a learner can expect from this program:

* The initial Days would lay the foundations in programming & statistics on which we would model our study on machine learning.
* We'd start with Python followed by the basics of Object Oriented programming. Following this we'll slowly advance into Numpy, Pandas and Visualizations
* Once we get a tight hold on Python, we'll venture into statistics and exploratory data anlaysis which would involve a lot of the python and visualzation skills.
* We also learn linear and logistic regression.


# Software and Libraries
This project uses the following software and Python libraries: 
NumPy, pandas, Sklearn / scikit-learn, Matplotlib (for data visualization), Seaborn (for data visualization)
